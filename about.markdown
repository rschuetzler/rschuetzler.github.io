I am an Assistant Professor in the Information Systems Department at the BYU Marriott School of Business. My research focuses on how people interact with new forms of technology. As part of my work, Iâ€™ve built a chat bot, several websites, and an embodied conversational agent. I love running experiments and testing out new things.
