I am an Assistant Professor in the Information Systems and Quantitative Analysis Department at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. My research focuses on how people interact with new forms of technology. As part of my work, Iâ€™ve built a chat bot, several websites, and an embodied conversational agent. I love running experiments and testing out new things.
