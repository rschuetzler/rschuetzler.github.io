I am Ryan Schuetzler, and this is my home on the web. I am a professor at Brigham Young University where I work on conversational agent research. I love messing around with new technology, learning new things, and teaching. I want to be a force for good in the world, and I hope that my research and teaching help me help others.

Check out the [blog](/blog) for my thoughts on a whole bunch of things. You can also check out my [CV](/schuetzler_cv.pdf) If you're interested in reading more about my research and hunting down my papers. I've archived as many of my papers as possible at [SelectedWorks](https://works.bepress.com/rschuetzler/#), so if you want to read my papers, that's the place to check. You could also take a look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IIOnxOUAAAAJ&hl=en), or follow me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYPdxIGzkC4VCH1bt6c92DQ) to learn all about whatever I'm teaching this year :D.
