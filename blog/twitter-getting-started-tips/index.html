<meta name="description" content="I think I have procrastinated long enough in trying out the whole Twitter phenomenon, so I’m giving it a try. It’s been all over the news lately, apparently receiving $48 million worth of free publicity in the last month. So far, here are my impressions It&#39;s super easy to use, and really easy to get set up with an account. I love the fact that your entire life must be reduced to a 160-character bio. A Twitter client is the way to go. I haven&#39;t settled on any one particular client yet, but I can tell that it is a much easier way to use Twitter than through the web interface. So far I&#39;ve used Seesmic Desktop, TweetDeck, and Tweetie (Mac only). Spammers are everywhere, so don&#39;t automatically following everyone who follows you. My first follower was some &quot;girl&quot; from a dating site of some kind. Check out a person&#39;s page before you follow them. It is way to easy to fill up your homepage with a bunch of updates you don&#39;t actually care about. Don&#39;t obsess over getting people to follow you. All you can do is post about what you are interested in, and hope that others are interested. &quot;If you build it, [they] will come.&quot; Something I learned from using Facebook: Don&#39;t use Twitter to update your facebook status more than about 2x per day. You&#39;ll start to flood people&#39;s newsfeeds and that&#39;s just annoying. Twitter is supposed to be updated that frequently. Facebook really isn&#39;t. So, I’ve only been on for a few days, but those are my tidbits of wisdom for anyone looking to start along the Twitter path." />
