    <p>If blog regularly on Blogger/Blogspot/whatever it's called, you have probably run into the frustration that is adding pictures to a post. While it is possible, it is certainly not an easy task to get pictures where you want them, with the text around them like you like. For all you Windows users out there, there is an easier way. It's called <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer">Windows Live Writer</a>.</p>

    <p>As part of a web computing class, a couple other students and I created a website called <a href="http://www.videorentalexperts.com">MyFlixList</a>. As extra credit for the course, we were told to apply the things we learned about PageRank and SEO to become the top search result on Google for the term <a href="http://www.videorentalexperts.com">mis510proj</a>. Here is a basic summary of the steps we took to become the number 1 result (which we are as of press time).</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make the title of the page mis510proj. That was one of the requirements of the project, but it's a good idea.</li>
	<li>Have the keyword in the domain. We were not allowed to spend money on the project, so that was out. However, we could have used mis510proj.videorentalexperts.com. We decided not to since most other groups didn't even have a domain name.</li>
	<li>Include mis510proj in a keywords metatag. Our meta tag (inside the &lt;head&gt; tags at the top of the page) looks something like this: &lt;meta name="keywords" content="mis510proj, movies, netflix" /&gt;</li>
	<li>Have an image titled mis510proj on the site. We used the main logo</li>
	<li>Link sharing. I cannot overstate the importance of this step. We contacted other groups and offered to link to them if they would link to us. The more links we had to our site using mis510proj as the anchor text, the better off we were</li>
	<li>Use the keyword in natural language. We have a paragraph at the bottom of the homepage that uses the keyword mis510proj a bunch of times. Be careful not to overdue this, as too many mentions of the keyword will actually hurt more than it helps. We also have the keyword inside an &lt;h1&gt; tag, which shows that it is an important part of the site</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all the basic tips I have for SEO. There are a ton of other things that are important, but this is a decent primer for how to get started getting ranked for a keyword on Google.</p>

    <p>Part of a project for my web mining class at UA is to create a website using 5 different APIs to accomplish some sort of useful task. A group of us have created a site to queue up movies you want to see, and be able to see those movies on Netflix, get reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, and purchase the movie from Amazon. It's called <a title="mis510proj" href="http://www.videorentalexperts.com">MyFlixList</a>. Functionality is coming along nicely, so feel free to check it out here: <a title="mis510proj" href="http://www.videorentalexperts.com">mis510proj</a>.</p>

    <p>In my quest to find the perfect tool to manage my ever-expanding library of PDFs, I discovered a tool called <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/" target="_blank">Mendeley</a>. Here's a quick rundown of what Mendeley does for me:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Manages references - this is similar to EndNote. You can put references into folders based on topic, class, project, paper, or whatever you want.</li>
	<li>Manages PDFs - I have it set up to move all my PDFs to one folder and rename them to Author - Year - Title. I then use Dropbox to sync that folder to all my computers so I can always have access to my PDFs when I want them. <strong>Edit</strong>: Mendeley provides a sync service, but the free version is limited to 500 MB of individual space and 500 MB free space. Since I have the files in a Dropbox folder anyway, I just use that.</li>
	<li>Cite while you write - The functionality for this isn't quite as full-fledged as EndNote, but you can insert citations and a bibliography that is automatically updated based on the citations. More on this below.</li>
	<li>Lit review - this is one of the killer features. Most references have an entry in the "Mendeley online Catalog." If you go to the online catalog, you can see links to similar articles.</li>
	<li>Collaboration - you can create collaborative groups of references, and everyone can have access to the same library of references and PDFs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm new to it, so I'm sure I will run into some limitations, but right now it seems like a pretty awesome tool. Also, you can import to/export from EndNote if you have to continue using that to work with other EndNote users.</p>

  </h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date">30 October 2010</span>
  </p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>«p&gt;I love hard boiled eggs. Unfortunately, I don’t love peeling them because I usually end up with as much egg attached to the shell as not. I’ve scoured the globe looking for ways to avoid this frustration, and today, for the first time, I have cooked and peeled hard boiled eggs without wanting to break something. Here is my secret:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<ol>
	<li>For 12 eggs, put them all in a big pot with cold water to cover them about 2 inches</li>
	<li>Add about 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to water</li>
	<li>Place on burner on high</li>
	<li>When the water begins to boil, set a timer for 3 minutes</li>
	<li>After 3 minutes, remove from heat and cover. Leave for 8 minutes</li>
	<li>After 8 minutes, run cool water over the eggs for a little bit, then soak them in ice water for about 30-45 minutes</li>
	<li>Place eggs in refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours</li>
	<li>When ready to peel, tap an egg on the counter (all the way around) to break up the shell</li>
	<li>Lightly roll the egg on the counter to break the shell even more. If you roll to hard, the shell might start to come off, bringing some egg white with it</li>
	<li>Peel egg under running water, starting at the fat end.</li>
	<li>Take your time, but it should go fairly quickly, and be pretty easy to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like I said, this is a compilation of a bunch of different tips I've found. I don't know if it's possible to remove some of them and still have an easy time. I just know that for the first time in a long time I didn't want to kill something after peeling a dozen hard boiled eggs.</p>
