All I wanted was a way to add a new note to Evernote from Launchy without having to open up Evernote&#39;s whole interface and do all sorts of clicking and such. After a bunch of digging, and a little bit of scripting, I finally created a way to do it. Take the evernoteadd.bat script and place it anywhere you want. Replace my &quot;_INBOX&quot; with whatever default folder you want these notes to go to. Then simply create a Launchy action in Runner with this batch file as the program, and &quot;$$&quot; &quot;$$&quot; as the arguments. To create a new note from Launchy, type the name of the action you created, hit TAB, type the title of the note TAB text of the note RETURN. Download the script UPDATE: Thanks to StackOverflow, I figured out a way to make the script work without a temp file. I&#39;ve updated the script accordingly" />

    <p>I love <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>. And I love <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a>. But it turns out that combining the two was more difficult than I expected.

<p>Take the <a href="https://gist.github.com/rschuetzler/5380448">evernoteadd.bat script</a> and place it anywhere you want. Replace my <code>"_INBOX"</code> with whatever default folder you want these notes to go to. Then simply create a Launchy action in Runner with this batch file as the program, and <code>"$$" "$$"</code> as the arguments. To create a new note from Launchy, type the name of the action you created, hit TAB, type the title of the note TAB text of the note RETURN.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15994824/faking-standard-input-on-the-windows-command-line">StackOverflow</a>, I figured out a way to make the script work without a temp file. I've updated the script accordingly</p>
