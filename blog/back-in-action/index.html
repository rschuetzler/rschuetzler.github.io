    <p>Man, it’s been a while. With the craziness of first trying to finish a dissertation in
time, then trying to defend that dissertation, then packing and moving half-way across the
country, then staring a new job, teaching a class (I’ve taught it before, but I’m trying
to make it more awesome), and all that those entail, I haven’t even had time to think
about the blog.  Add to that the complication that I ended up removing my Linux server VM
from my computer when I screwed something up horribly and had to reinstall. That broke my
Octopress deployment process, so for a while there I didn’t even know <em>how</em> to update my
blog, even if I’d had time to do it.</p>

<p>But here I am.  I’ve got the blog deployment back up and running, and I can maybe see
myself making time to write up some tutorials about things I run across.  I’m working on
creating a set of networking labs using <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> and
<a href="http://virtualbox.org">Virtualbox</a>, so maybe I’ll talk about some of the things I’ve
learned from that.  I’m sure I’ll also talk about the experience of moving from grad
school to professorhood, but that’s still pretty new, so I’ll let things settle down a bit
before I try to distill my thoughts.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m back. I’m still alive. And moving sucks and I never want to do it again.</p>
