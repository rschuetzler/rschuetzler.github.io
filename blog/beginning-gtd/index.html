    <p>As a student, my plate is always full. There are so many things I could be doing at any given time of the day.

I know, of course, that there is never really &quot;done&quot; in the life of an academic. Of course, there&#039;s not really &quot;done&quot; in any life. There are always more things to take on, more projects to complete.</p>

<p>I have tried to do lists in the past. I&#039;ve been through many. I&#039;ve tried productivity systems like Pomodoro, but to no avail. They helped me work, but I never really had a clear sense of <em>what</em> ****</p>
