    <p>So, I’ve already tried to make it clear that
<a href="http://www.schuetzler.net/blog/latex-icis-template/">I really hate Word</a> for
creating academic documents. The biggest reason is that it frequently screws
things up. So I use LaTeX, and I think you should too. Admittedly, it’s not
always possible. Some journals, conferences, or other venues require submission
in Word. Sometimes you have collaborators who absolutely will not go through the
effort of learning LaTeX. But if you have the opportunity, I absolutely
recommend that you use LaTeX.</p>

<p>Here are just a couple of the advantages of LaTeX:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plain text source files. If something breaks, you only have to look through
the plain text files to find and fix it. If something breaks in a Word
document, you pretty much have to find an old version and then redo all your
work.</li>
  <li>Version control. Version control is commonly thought of for source
code. Programmers use it to keep track of changes, so that if things break
they have a working version to fall back on. The same thing goes for LaTeX
documents. You can create versions of your document as you go along, which
allows you to keep old versions around without having 65 copies of the draft
in your working directory.
<!-- more --></li>
  <li>Table and Figure cross-references. Oh boy is this a great one. Word tries to
do this, but inevitably when you move things around, the cross-references
will break. With LaTeX you can simply use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">\ref{}</code> command to reference a
table or figure by number. If the figures move around, the refs automatically
update (like Word is supposed to).</li>
  <li>Citation management. There are a plethora of tools available for citation
management in Word. EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley, Qiqqa, and probably a million
others. Many of these tools also work with LaTeX. But even more importantly,
citations don’t break in LaTeX. Because it’s all in plain text, there’s
nothing to break.</li>
  <li>It’s just beautiful. Because LaTeX is a typesetting engine and not a word
processor, it can do pretty things with your text like kerning (relevant
<a href="http://xkcd.com/1015/">xkcd</a>) and figure placement in much better ways than
Word.</li>
  <li>Simple switching between formats. If you’ve set up your document correctly,
you can switch between formats for different journals or publications
extremely easily. That means that while you’re writing you can use one
format, then bada-bing, bada-boom! you can transform it to a new format with
the flip of a <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="k">\documentclass</span></code> switch. Maybe Word magicians can make it
happen there, but I’ve never seen it.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s just a few. Basically, LaTeX makes everything about creating a
document for publication about 1.6 gazillion times better. Now, that’s not to
say LaTeX is all peaches and cream. It has its downsides, too. Here are a few
I’ve run into:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conferences not accepting PDF. That’s a big bummer, and it pretty much means
LaTeX is out. There are tools like pandoc and LaTeX2rtf to convert from LaTeX
to RTF, which can then be converted to Word files, but in my experience it’s
been more of a hassle than it’s worth. Too much of the formatting is lost in
translation.</li>
  <li>Steep learning curve. LaTeX is a typesetting engine with a lot of
power. Unfortunately with that power comes a lot of extra gunk. It takes time
to learn the ins and outs, and it takes some time to even get started. Once
you get over the hump, you’ll wish you never had to use Word again, and
you’ll wonder why you ever did. But until then, you’ll probably spend a lot
of time with Google.</li>
  <li>Collaborators may not want to learn. See downside #2.</li>
  <li>You have to compile to see your changes in action. LaTeX is a bit funny, in
that you often have compile a document 2 or 3 times to get the desired
result. Each run is doing something different: finding references, converting
references, fixing references, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>This post (and hopefully series of posts) will be designed to teach you the
basics of how to use LaTeX to write an academic article. My goal is to start
with the basics, then slowly build up to a full-fledged journal paper, complete
with figures, tables, cross-references, citations, and anything else you might
need. If you have requests, put them in the comments and I can try to address
them in future posts.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-downloading-latex">Step 1: Downloading LaTeX</h2>

<p>The first thing you will need to get is a LaTeX distribution. The most
common are <a href="http://miktex.org/download">MiKTeX</a> (for Windows)
<a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a> (for Windows and *nix), and
<a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> (for Mac). Each of these comes with a
package manager that will install packages that you need on the fly. I highly
recommend you enable this option in whichever distribution you use, because it
will make your work much simpler, especially when you are getting started and
using a whole bunch of new packages.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-creating-your-first-article">Step 2: Creating your first article</h2>

<p>Here I’ve created a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> file containing everything you’ll need to get
started. Create your own file ending in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code>, and make sure Windows isn’t
automatically adding a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> to it. You can do it in TeXworks, the MiKTeX
bundled TeX editor, by pressing File -&gt; New. I’m not sure what editor, if any,
comes with TeXLive, so you’re on your own until someone comments to tell me.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rschuetzler/11290131.js"></script>

<p>The basic structure of a LaTeX document is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Preamble. This holds all of the package information, function definitions,
and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">documentclass</code>.
    <ol>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="k">\documentclass</span><span class="p">{}</span></code> tells LaTeX what kind of document you are creating. If
you wanted to have chapters, you could use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">report</code> class. Since we
are creating a basic article, we will use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">article</code> class.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\title{This Is My First Document}</code> tells LaTeX what the title of the
document will be. This will be used in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">\maketitle</code> command below</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\author{Ryan Schuetzler}</code> is where you’ll put your name.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">document</code> environment is where the body of the document will
reside. This encompasses everything between <code class="highlighter-rouge">\begin{document}</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\end{document}</code>.
    <ol>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\maketitle</code> tells LaTeX to put the title of the document here. This is
basically the header, and is defined by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">documentclass</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\section{}</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">\subsection{}</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\subsubsection{}</code> are the three levels
of section headings available in LaTeX. They basically correspond to
Heading 1, 2, and 3 in Word. If you want to go even deeper, you can use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\paragraph{}</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\subparagraph{}</code>, but maybe you should first consider
whether you really want to go that far down in headings.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the document environment, paragraphs are separated by an empty line of
text. You can put as many sentences as you want on one line, and LaTeX will
automatically format them as a single paragraph. My preferred method, however,
is to create new lines every ~80 characters. As long as they are all together,
LaTeX will format them as one paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-compile">Step 3: Compile</h2>

<p>Once you’ve created your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> file, compile it with pdfLaTeX. I default in
MiKTeX to using the pdfLaTeX+MakeIndex+BibTeX compilation, since that will
usually run everything I need. Press the green button that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LBszbx7.png" alt="Compile that sucker!" /></p>

<p>Assuming that worked, you’re done! You have successfully compiled your first
LaTeX article. And you have everything you need to begin creating a document of
your own. Create your headers, add some text, and watch LaTeX work its
magic. Don’t worry about the specifics of formatting for now. If you don’t like
the section numbers, or the indentation of paragraphs, or the date in the title,
that’s fine. All of that can be changed later, independent of the actual text
you write. So get started!</p>
