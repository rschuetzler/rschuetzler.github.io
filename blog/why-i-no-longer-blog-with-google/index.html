    <p>I&#039;m not a frequent blogger. I&#039;ve given blogging a go several times in the past five or so years, and it&#039;s never really stuck with me. Or rather, I&#039;ve never really stuck with it. I&#039;ve done self-hosted Wordpress, Drupal, and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I also have a Tumblr blog I used for a few months, and an old Wordpress.com hosted blog that I&#039;ve abandoned. Most recently I tried out blogging on Google+ following the advice of G+ addict <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MikeElgan/posts/QF2xfRi5erH">+Mike Elgan</a>.</p>

<p>In his article about <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232329/Why_I_blog_on_Google_And_how_">blogging on Google+</a>, Mike makes some really great points. It is very easy to share, connect, comment, and just generally interact with people on G+. Unfortunately, it&#039;s not (yet) designed to be a blogging platform.</p>

<p>The biggest limitation I felt when using Google+ as a blog is the inability to have true hyperlinks. Sure, you can have a bunch of links in a post, but URLs are ugly. Nobody wants to see the full URL of an Android application, or even of another Google+ post. So when composing a post, it is limited to the one link that G+ turns into a prettified link at the bottom.</p>

<p>Another issue I have with G+ blogging is the lack of permanence. I use my blog as a way to record things I learn, and hopefully to help others who may run into similar problems that I have. With Google+, I feel like anything older than the past 5 posts disappears. I know it&#039;s still there, but there&#039;s no easy way for me to get to it. A regular old blog lets me have tags, categories, and an archive. All things that I find useful for organizing my stored knowledge.</p>

<p>So, here I am back on Wordpress giving blogging another try. Maybe I&#039;ll stick with it, and maybe I won&#039;t. But I have given Google+ a fair shake, and it just didn&#039;t work out. At least not yet.</p>
