    <p>There's a curse that comes with being a doctoral student. The curse is that
I can rarely take the results of any study at face value. I suppose this has
more to do with learning statistics than being a doctoral student, but
nevertheless, I have a problem. So today when I read a recent article from <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired</a> about <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/opposites-dont-attract-and-thats-bad-news/">how
    apparently opposites don't really attract</a>, I got a little suspicious
about some of the conclusions of one of the studies they mentioned.</p>

<p>The study comes from Angela Bahns, Kate Pickett, and Christian Crandall at
Wellesley College and the University of Kansas. In the study, researchers
approached pairs of people on college campuses to ask them questions about
religion and views on various social issues. The study found that pairs on a
large, more diverse college campus were more similar to each other than pairs
on smaller, more homogeneous college campuses.</p>

<p>This finding is interesting. Given more opportunity to make diverse friends,
we would expect pairs of friends to be more diverse, but that does not appear
to be the case. However, the researchers make the conclusion that the increased
diversity causes the students to seek out similar-minded friends. I would argue
that rather than the diversity causing people to seek out similar friends, that
the size of the university allowed students to find similar people.</p>

<p>Merely finding that students at a large university have more similar friends
than at a small university is an interesting finding. However, it's tempting to
make guesses as to why that is. Because these researchers were studying
diversity, they put the blame on diversity. It may be true that more diverse
universities cause students to seek out similar-minded acquaintences. However,
this study didn't look at that specifically. In order to determine that
diversity is the causal factor would require the researchers to at least
compare universities of the same size. One large diverse university could be
compared to a large homogeneous university and the similarity of friendships in
that case could be compared. Otherwise, any of a million confounding factors
could be causing the similar friends to come together</p>
